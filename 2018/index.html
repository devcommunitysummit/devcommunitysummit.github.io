								<h6>10:40&ndash;11:20 AM <span>&#8226; Joni Pepin, Abdulbaseer Khan, Bill Pratt</span></h6>
								<p>For Android Summit 2018, we wanted to build an app that was cross-platform, performant, polished, and reusable. We were constrained by time and developer resources. Luckily, we had a solution: a combination of Flutter, Firebase, and Interns! What resulted from our Summer labor of love is the app you&rsquo;re (hopefully) using during this year&rsquo;s Android Summit. We&rsquo;ll give an overview of how we wrote parts of the app, any pitfalls we encountered, and our thoughts on Flutter as a development framework.</p>

I&rsquo;ll share insights on human-centered design opportunities that can help both an independent developer or an established corporation.

								<h5>Designing With Constraints</h5>
								<h6>3:15&ndash;3:55 PM <span>&#8226; Sean McQuillan</span></h6>
								<p>In this talk you will learn best practices for using Constraint Layout on Android. If you&rsquo;ve been using Constraint Layout since release or are just checking it out then this talk is for you. Learn when to use Constraint Layout, and equally important, when to use other layouts. You&rsquo;ll see how Constraint Layout can help you build complex designs on Android. You&rsquo;ll also learn how to build Constraint Layout animations with Motion Layout</p>

								<h6>4:00&ndash;4:40 PM <span>&#8226; Sean McQuillan</span></h6>
								<p>In this talk you will learn about how to design Android slices to bring users back to your app. Slices are a Jetpack library that allow you to expose your app in more places like keywords in the Android Google Search App. You can use slices to show key app flows, recall past content, or discover new content. With a focus on re-engagement, you can use slices to bump your metrics. You&rsquo;ll also learn about other features on Android to design for apps metrics.</p>

								<h5>Taming Public Device Clouds for App Testing</h5>
								<h6>1:00&ndash;1:40 PM <span>&#8226; Shauvik Roy Choudhary</span></h6>
								<p>The need for testing Android apps across multiple devices has never been more relevant than now. Fragmentation is at an all-time high, with 6 OS versions having over 5% user share, 127 mobile device makers and the multitude of variations within them make it extremely hard to test on different devices. Fortunately, there are several public device clouds, including Amazon&rsquo;s Device Farm, Google&rsquo;s Firebase Test Lab and Microsoft&rsquo;s App Center that provide a variety of devices available for test, allowing developers to run automated scripts across them. In this talk, we will share our experience with public device clouds and will empirically compare/contrast the different services, and how testing on them can fit into an agile CI/CD process. After this talk, the attendees would have tools and sample code to try out these device clouds and will be able to manage the process effectively while getting the best ROI.</p>

								<h5>Gra-Fi-Te: Leveraging Gradle and Firebase for Android Testing</h5>
								<h6>1:45&ndash;2:25 PM <span>&#8226; Santosh Astagi</span></h6>
								<p>We encounter Android projects with different structures &mdash; Multi module, Instant app with features and more recently Kotlin multi-platform projects. This talk will focus on leveraging Gradle and Firebase Test lab to simplify the process of testing. After a primer on useful testing command line tools, the talk presents gradle scripts to combine commands and create reports for the different Android project types. The talk ends introducing Firebase lab testing and test sharding to reduce test times.</p>

								<h5>TDD the C++ Layer of an Android App</h5>
								<h6>3:15&ndash;3:55 PM <span>&#8226; Giorgio Natili</span></h6>
								<p>Although you use Java or Kotlin in your apps, the compiler generates JVM-optimized byte-code. The generated code is pretty fast but native code it&rsquo;s even faster and this aspect could play an important role when your app deals with physics simulations and signal processing.</p>
								<p>You may be tempted to use native code only, but then you are going to miss all the benefits of a fully implemented presentation layer. The most reasonable solution seems to use the JNI for accessing a native layer written in C++, in fact, despite some overhead, you can then take advantage of the rich Android UI and the performances of native code. A compelling use case for C++ is audio applications. To hit a market of fragmented devices like Android, you must implement solutions with the lower latency possible and C++ excels in this.</p>
								<p>During this session, I will drive you into the building blocks of integrating, consuming and testing C++ in Android to implement a high performing sound processing YAFA (i.e. yet another fart app) app.</p>

								<h5>Brewing Espresso with Solar Power: Practical Android Testing</h5>
								<h6>4:00&ndash;4:40 PM <span>&#8226; Nick Dipatri</span></h6>
								<p>Left-shifted automated testing is hard but, if done right, it pays off. I&rsquo;ll cover practical testing scenarios using Android&rsquo;s Espresso framework and compare live testing on real hardware with mock testing. To create repeatable, useful, integration tests, I&rsquo;ll also use Dagger to inject mock Bluetooth hardware and MockWebServer to simulate external RESTful endpoints. I&rsquo;ll use a simple project &mdash; which retrieves current wattage output from solar panels on my roof &mdash; to make this talk exciting, so bring sunglasses and pray for sun!</p>

							<h5>Self-Care for Developers: Defense Against the Dark Arts</h5>
							<h6>5:10&ndash;5:50 PM &#8226; Nitya Narasimhan</h6>
							<p>A Harry Potter-inspired revision of my ElaConf talk on Self Care. Basic focus is on the developer, not the technology. The simple recognition that technology moves fast, we are all workaholics, and that self-care is critical to being productive and happy. Bottom line: we are humans first, developers second &mdash; so let&rsquo;s prioritize that. This will focus on my own journey in recognizing the need for establishing work boundaries, boosting self-esteem and de-stigmatizing mental health so that we can create more healthy developers and in turn lead to more innovative products &amp; collaborative environments.</p>
