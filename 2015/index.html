						<h5>Design Keynote: Open Design</h5>
						<h6>9:15 AM&ndash;9:45 AM <span>&#8226; Dan Makoski</span></h6>
						<p>People are amazing. They are unique and tribal, emotional and rational, don&rsquo;t always know what they want, yet can dream of an incredible future. And if we&rsquo;re honest with ourselves, their experiences with the things we design and create is the ultimate measure of our success. The physics and chemistry of this reality poses fundamental challenges to traditional notions of design. This talk proposes that a radically open design process is the key to unlocking the power latent in extraordinary, everyday people.</p>

						<h5>Development Keynote: How to be an Android Expert</h5>
						<h6>9:45 AM&ndash;10:15 AM <span>&#8226; Chiu-Ki Chan</span></h6>
						<p>Think of an Android expert. Why do you consider this person an expert? &ldquo;She knows a lot about Android&rdquo;, you say. But how do you know? You know because she shares her knowledge, through blogs, talks, StackOverflow etc.<br><br>Experts are just that, people who share their knowledge. Sharing puts you in a positive feedback loop: the more you share, the more knowledgeable you become. Let me walk you through some concrete steps you can take to start sharing and build up your expertise.</p>

							<h5>Android Libraries - Knowing When &amp; What to Consider</h5>
							<h6>11:45 AM&ndash;12:30 PM <span>&#8226; Annyce Davis</span></h6>
							<p>The number of Android Libraries available is enormous and that number continues to grow day-by-day! But should you try to incorporate them all into your application? Do you really need to use EventBus, RxJava, and Custom Observables? How many different image libraries have you included? Hopefully you get the point, great Android apps only include what&rsquo;s needed to achieve the goals of the product, not enhance the resume of the developer.<br><br>In this talk learn four components essential to developing maintainable Android applications. What criteria should you use when choosing a library to include in your project? What simple changes can you adopt to improve your domain design? What tools are available to assist you in delivering high quality code? What can you start doing today to make your app more maintainable? Walk away with the tools you need to be a good Android citizen!</p>

							<p>Developers of Android will inevitably be familiar with the term &ldquo;Material Design&rdquo;, but what does that mean, exactly? This talk will answer that question by explaining the fundamental principles underlying Material Design, why Material Design is beneficial for developers and how developers can implement it in their Android applications. It will also include case studies of developers who&rsquo;ve successfully implemented Material principles and seen amazing returns.</p>

							<h5>Think like an Animator</h5>
							<h6>11:00 AM&ndash;11:45 AM <span>&#8226; Zack Sultan &amp; Kevin Grant</span></h6>
							<p>Due to a variety of issues, Android&rsquo;s design is typically left in the wayside to its iOS brethren, leaving the unsuspecting Android developer to their own discretion in bringing a product to life in a different ecosystem.<br><br>Interfaces jump and pop around, flickering in and out on linear paths with little regard to a feeling of consistency or purpose. List views slam gracelessly into walls. Transitions between screens are chunky, aimless zooms. Even much of the much-touted &ldquo;Material design&rdquo; is clunky. It makes otherwise useful and nice looking apps feel confusing and second rate.<br><br>That means more confusion and less engagement among your users.<br><br>The solution: Android engineers need to become animators. We cover basic principles of animation, how these can be applied to the Android platform, and how to work with designers (or on your own) to mock them up.</p>

							<h5>Workshop: Android Marshmallow Permissions</h5>
							<h6>1:30 PM&ndash;3:00 PM <span>&#8226; Mark Murphy</span></h6>
							<p>Android 6.0 changed how we work with certain &ldquo;dangerous&rdquo; permissions, such as reading contacts, writing to external storage, or using the camera. It used to be that all you needed to do was request them in the manifest, and you got them. Now, you *also* need to ask the user at runtime whether you can have permission&hellip; and the user might say &ldquo;no&rdquo;, or even &ldquo;no, and please stop asking&rdquo;. Even if the user grants you permission, the user can go into Settings and revoke the permission later on. In this workshop, we will explore these changes to Android&rsquo;s permissions system and their ramifications on your app. Along the way, you will have the opportunity to participate, hands-on, as we take an existing Android app and add support for Android 6.0 runtime permissions.<br><br>(NOTE: Those interested in participating in the hands-on portion should bring a notebook with Android Studio and the Android 6.0 SDK bits installed. Those preferring to watch the presenter do all the work are welcome to bring popcorn.)</p>

Attendees will engage in activities to explore the physical qualities of Material Design in a three-dimensional environment.

							<h5>Blending Brand and Material Design</h5>

							<p>When Material Design was first announced I was ecstatic. Finally, Google had a platform-unifying design theory that was thoughtful, beautiful, and overflowing with user experience possibilities. But there wasn&rsquo;t any guidance on how brand personality could be blended into the Material Design system.<br><br>Until now. With the help of Google, some Material Design Award-winning apps, and The Breakfast Club, I&rsquo;ll describe various brand attributes, then outline strategies for incorporating them into Material Design.</p>
