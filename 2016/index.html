								<h5>Android Application Security, The Right Way</h5>
								<h6>10:00 AM&ndash;10:45 AM <span>&#8226; Dario Incalza</span></h6>
								<p>Still too many applications do not meet the high security standards for today&rsquo;s threat landscape. Numerous applications are being attacked and attackers are, unfortunately, often successful at doing so. So in this talk I would like to go over the different attacks that threat Android applications today. Afterwards, I will propose best practices and tools that every Android developer can use to secure his application, and by doing so, significantly raising the bar for hackers. This talk aims to illustrate that not every developer needs to be a security expert in order to harden their application.</p>

When it comes to innovation, Mobile devices and apps have run into a great big wall. What&rsquo;s next? It&rsquo;s no longer good enough to know a user is playing your game; apps must know the where, when and how of a user, to compete and be unique.

								<h5>Multi-Window &amp; ChromeOS</h5>
								<h6>3:30 PM&ndash;5:00 PM <span>&#8226; Mark Murphy</span></h6>
								<p>Vendors large and small have offered multiple windows in their Android devices. Now, with Android 7.0, we are getting multiple windows in standard Android&hellip; and in the new Android-on-ChromeOS environment. This class will explore how to support multi-window modes in your Android applications, with particular emphasis on the split-screen mode for phones and tablets, plus the freeform mode available on ChromeOS (and, perhaps elsewhere). We will look at how your app will behave in these environments without any changes and how you can make minor tweaks to improve your results. We will also examine what quirks will be seen with multi-window mode and what sorts of UX decisions you will need to make as a result. Finally, we will see how you can start testing your app in these modes, to begin making tactical changes and run experiments for longer-term strategic choices.</p>

								<p>For the success of our apps, we often add end user documentation in the form of help notes, tutorials and app demos/tours. Such end user docs are often outdated leading to confused users who make noise on support channels and worse on the play store. Tests also have the same problem &mdash; they need to be updated after the app changes to keep them in sync. However, tests produce pass/fail reports to indicate out of sync problems. So, why not kill two birds with one stone? I&rsquo;ll show how end-to-end UI tests can generate beautiful user docs for happy cases and make sure they're never out of date.</p>
