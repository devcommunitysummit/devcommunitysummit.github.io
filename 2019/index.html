As we walk through each pattern individually, you&rsquo;ll learn the nuances of each one and what makes it better than the others. At the end, these acronyms will no longer be buzzwords. Instead, you&rsquo;ll have a clear understanding about how to use them to maintain a robust and extensible codebase.</p>

								<h5>DIY Dependency Injection with Kotlin</h5>
								<h6>11:35 AM&ndash;12:15 PM <span>&#8226; Sam Edwards</span></h6>
								<p>Dependency Injection seems like this SUPER complex topic that only the most senior developers understand. At the end of the day, it&rsquo;s just &ldquo;inversion of control&rdquo; where instances of objects/classes are provided to you, instead of created by you. Kotlin&rsquo;s language features allow us to do this concisely, without a library, and in this talk I&rsquo;ll show you how to DO IT YOURSELF. This talk will demystify dependency injection and help you understand the huge benefits it provides for testing, maintainability and modularity.</p>

								<p>While you can use RxJava in Kotlin, coroutines are likely to be the long-term reactive solution for Kotlin in Android app development.</p>
								<p>In this workshop, we will experiment with migrating a small Retrofit-and-Room code base from using RxJava to using coroutines. Along the way, we will see how coroutines integrate with ViewModel and LiveData, how to use channels and flows, and how to test coroutines.</p>

								<h5>From 0 to 100: Fine-tune all the things!</h5>
								<h6>3:50 PM&ndash;4:30 PM <span>&#8226; Pablo Guardiola</span></h6>
								<p>In this session we will talk about all the performance bottlenecks that we found along the way developing the Mapbox Navigation SDK for Android. We will learn how we made decisions based on numbers and tackled them: from designing and implementing a pipeline that runs automated tests, to selecting and analyzing the data obtained from these tests. We will show the tools and platforms used, such as Systrace, test @Rules, and AWS Device farm.</p>
								<p>When you are developing SDKs or libraries, their performance is crucial to your customers, especially in the context of turn-by-turn navigation. A complete navigation experience includes voice announcements, real-time user progress to their destination, smooth map camera animations, detecting when a user goes off-route, and more. As you can imagine, all of these components are critical when building a navigation app, but at the same time taxing in terms of performance.</p>

								<h5>Testing for Success in the Real World</h5>
								<h6>9:30 AM&ndash;10:30 AM &#8226; Donn Felker</h6>
								<p>Does that code you just wrote actually work? How do you know? How do your teammates know? You did write tests for that, right? What kind did you write though? Unit? Integration? System? End-to-End? What about mocking and stubbing? I know, you only changed two lines of a legacy piece of the app&hellip; but still, how do you know this didn&rsquo;t break anything?</p>
								<p>Ugh. Let&rsquo;s face it testing your application is difficult and tedious. Where can you get the most bang for your buck? What&rsquo;s the 20% of work that gets you 80% of the return? In this session you&rsquo;ll learn where you can focus your attention to gain the most traction in your testing endeavors. From mocking api calls, to juxtaposing the benefits of unit testing vs end-to-end testing, we&rsquo;ll cover it all.</p>

								<h5>Real-Time Animation Using Flare and Flutter</h5>
								<h6>9:30 AM&ndash;12:15 PM <span>&#8226; Guido Rosso &amp; Luigi Rosso</span></h6>
								<p>Flare took the Flutter world by storm when it was announced at Flutter Live last December! Flare is a powerful design and animation tool that lets you create gorgeous, intricate, interactive animations in Flutter (and more) that are limited only by your imagination. Flare should be a part of every Flutter developer&rsquo;s toolkit, but many developers are not familiar with how to use animation design software. Not after this event! 2Dimensions, the creators of Flare, will be presenting a 2-hour workshop specifically for Flutter developers. You&rsquo;ll learn how to set up a project, import custom artwork, create animations, and integrate with Flutter.</p>

								<h5>Firebase MLKit &mdash; AI in Android Town!!</h5>
								<h6>10:40 AM&ndash;11:20 AM <span>&#8226; Sweety Bertilla</span></h6>
								<p>Machine Learning Kit (ML Kit) has been introduced by Firebase which helps us to integrate AI without implementing complicated algorithms. In this presentation, you will learn how to detect faces, implement smart replies, train your data set and translate to any of 59 languages with just a few lines of code! If that sounds interesting, attend this talk to see a live demo of how it works in Android.</p>

								<h6>11:35 AM&ndash;12:15 PM <span>&#8226; Adri&aacute;n Catal&aacute;n</span></h6>
								<p>All those fancy keywords might make the content of this talk sound complex. Many concepts around AI and ML can be overwhelming or imply a time consuming steep learning curve. Fear not, both Flutter and Firebase come in our rescue. In this talk, we&rsquo;ll review basic concepts of Machine Learning, understand availability and capabilities of APIs provided by ML Kit(look ma, -almost-no math) and how to implement features like image labeling in our apps in no time (although time is a social construct).</p>

								<h5>(Android) Transformers &mdash; Bytecode in Disguise!</h5>
								<h6>1:00 PM&ndash;1:40 PM <span>&#8226; Doug Stevenson</span></h6>
								<p>If you&rsquo;ve used Firebase Performance Monitoring, you know that it automatically discovers and reports performance metrics for all the HTTP transactions in your app. But have you ever wondered how it does that? Android doesn&rsquo;t provide any APIs to listen in on an arbitrary connection (that would be a security problem!), and Firebase supports URLConnection, Apache, and OKHTTP APIs. The secret here is bytecode manipulation at build time using the Transform API provided by the Android build tools.</p>

								<h5>Awesome Android SDK Design &mdash; Leveraging Build-Aware SDK Builders for Better Library Design and Keeping Your Product Owners Happy</h5>
								<h6>1:00 PM&ndash;1:40 PM <span>&#8226; Jackson Cheek</span></h6>
								<p>Testing / Debug code should never be included in shipped Production code. You&rsquo;re building an Android SDK and as you develop the library, you are bound to have Debug build variant features (SDK tooling) that you definitely do not want to ship in Production code. But, these debug features are extremely helpful for Product Owners UAT and sales demos. So, how do you design an SDK with all of your awesome debug tooling and also avoid the riskiness of shipping them &ldquo;turned off&rdquo; in Production code?</p>

								<h5>Pragmatic Flexible UI</h5>
								<h6>2:40 PM&ndash;3:20 PM <span>&#8226; Sunitha Burri</span></h6>
								<p>&ldquo;Um&hellip; can a UI library allow its consumers to control look and feel of the UI entirely, not just the theming aspect, and yet rely on the shared code to bind data to UI elements?&rdquo; Yes, this is possible through a View ID Map solution that I have come up with. In this session, I will share my experience of working for a shared library, how &ldquo;View ID Map&rdquo; solution allowed the library to make UI flexible enough, so that the consuming apps could implement UI that conforms to their brand.</p>
