								<p>The book "Androids: the Team That Built the Android Operating System" tries to answer the question: Why did Android succeed? Along the way, it explores the stories of the people that created the OS.</p>
								<p>This session will do likewise, sharing some of the stories of that early team and culture and trying to give some sense of how, against all odds, Android managed to survive to where it is now available on over 3 billion devices today.</p>

								<h5>Automating Android Workflows with Github Actions</h5>
								<h6>1:10&ndash;1:50 PM <span>• Ubiratan Soares</span></h6>
								<p>When talking about CI/CD products, Github Actions is the new kid on block regarding and particularly it has been attracting a lot of attention from Software Engineering given its seamless integration with Github. It is not surprising that it has been quickly adopted both at open-source projects and private-source projects, with Android projects being no exception on that\n\nIn this talk we'll review the fundamentals of Github Actions as a CI/CD platform and learn how to make the most of it when designing and implementing automations particularly important for Android projects. We'll learn about particularities and limitations one might find when moving a big Android project over Github Actions and review most of the common solutions we have around for Android-specific use cases.</p>

								<p>Did you know that 15% of the worlds population experience some form of disability? Yet even with this high number, accessibility doesn’t often make the initial release of many projects - meaning that few of the things we build remove barriers for users who utilise accessibility features. With tools like Jetpack Compose, there is reduced friction in supporting these things in our apps - we just need to have the knowledge of how to implement them.\n\nAfter learning some foundations of how the behind the scenes of accessibility works with Compose, we’ll explore common accessibility pitfalls, along with how they can be tackled within Jetpack Compose. With this knowledge, you’ll be able to build Compose apps that can be used be everyone ❤️</p>

								<p>Untested code gets you on the road, but it will eventually slow you down. The prototype-to-production pipeline doesn’t always have the luxury of test-driven development. As a result, some production code has very low unit test coverage.\n\nIn this talk, you’ll learn how to use the new Espresso/UI-Automator based Kaspresso in unique ways to quickly stand up live, automated integration tests and keep production code reliably moving forward while your pit crew slowly builds up unit test coverage to 98 percent. You’ll learn how to use DaggerMock to migrate most of these live tests over time to more reliable mock integration tests. This talk will include a live demonstration, so fasten your seatbelts!</p>

								<p>There’s a rise in the number of libraries that encourage a “declarative” over “imperative” approach to creating UI. Every platform has at least one such library. Not only do these libraries offer a new way of thinking about programming, collectively they share a lot of similarities, regardless of the platform. \n\nWe know the rising popularity of declarative UI in Android with Jetpack Compose and iOS with Swift UI, but declarative UI has been used for quite some time on the web in React. We frequently hear people comment on the syntactic similarities between React and SwiftUI. In this presentation, Chris, Dheeru and Sweety would show a quick comparison of these three declarative UIs using a simple game app of tic tac toe.</p>

								<h5>Kotlin Multiplatform Library Development</h5>
								<h6>2:50&ndash;3:30 PM <span>• Kevin Galligan</span></h6>
								<p>Kotlin Multiplatform is maturing. There are a number of good libraries available, but to really shine, we'll need a few keystone libraries to emerge, and the door is wide open for a wave of specialized libraries. Less in the public view, some larger orgs are developing and publishing private KMP libraries internally, which presents its own set of issues. This talk is an update and refinement of a talk I gave in 2019. A number of changes have happened sense, or will happen soon. The IR compiler has stabilized, KSP support should be published for multiple platforms, and the Kotlin Native memory model rewrite is already in preview, and will likely be deployed in production next year. Library developers will need to understand these changes, but from a bigger picture perspective, these changes will allow for some missing libraries to be built, and pave the way for significantly broader adoption of KMP in the near future.\nIn this talk we'll cover \n* basic API design\n* expect/actual vs interfaces\n* considerations around publishing\n* platforms to support (KMM or more)\n* memory model considerations\n* HMPP\n* compiler plugins and KSP\n* library ideas</p>

								<h5>The Kotlin/Swift boundary</h5>
								<h6>3:40&ndash;4:20 PM <span>• Russell Wolf</span></h6>
								<p>Kotlin/Native can compile to Objective-C-compatible bytecode, but that doesn’t mean it looks natural to native iOS developers. While Kotlin and Swift are syntactically very similar, they solve certain problems in very different ways. For example, a Swift developer often uses a struct where a Kotlin developer uses a data class. This means the default ways that things translate from Kotlin through Objective-C into Swift don’t always come out looking idiomatic\n\nWe’ll talk through some of these differences, and strategies for dealing with them. Kotlin, Objective-C, and Swift are three different languages, and so we shouldn’t expect to be able to translate between them perfectly. But with a bit of care at the interop layer, we can make things a lot smoother in the iOS code.</p>
