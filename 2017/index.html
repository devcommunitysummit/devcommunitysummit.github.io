							<p>My life philosophy is to move forward, learn, explore and enjoy in the process, be open to emerging opportunities, people and situations that I meet on my path. All this and even more I get as a Test Engineer: unpredictability, the need to understand every little detail, the opportunity to work with smart, talented, extraordinary people. I got into the testing not in the usual way: I was born, grew up and got Master&rsquo;s in Law in Belarus. For some time I was engaged in scientific research in this field. Then I worked as an editor in chief for one of the publishing houses. Later, when the IT industry began to grow rapidly, I decided to try myself in a new role and I&rsquo;m incredibly happy about this ever since. Then there was a move to the US, working at Skype (Microsoft), various startup companies, and now at Groupon, contributing my share to creating a top rated mobile apps for iOS and Android!</p>

							<h6>9:00 AM&ndash;9:45 AM &#8226; Kelly Shuster</h6>
							<p>As a developer, sometimes it can feel like you are speaking a completely different language from your designer. Back and forth between design and development teams is a frustrating waste of time. Once your app is launched, bugs and unexpected user preferences can lead to even more churn. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be this way!</p>
							<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at techniques and tools that both sides can leverage to improve communication and increase efficiency. We&rsquo;ll also discuss how you can leverage testing throughout the entire process to improve app quality in both design and code. With these tools, developers and designers can work quickly and efficiently to create beautiful apps that users will adore!</p>

								<h5>Virtualization using Espresso Intents &amp; Mimic: Avoid Flaky Test Failures</h5>
								<h6>2:05 PM&ndash;2:50 PM <span>&#8226; Pradeep HK</span></h6>
								<p>Execution of automation regression everyday plays a vital role in success of Agile world, as this helps identify defects early. However, it has been observed that on an average 70% of the failures in automation execution is due to environment. Hence it becomes very important to keep the environment up and running during execution, which looks nearly impossible to ensure. Another approach is to make use of API virtualization. Mimic is a Mock API Services Manager for Android which enables us to manage API services locally on your Android device. Automating the process of managing API services using the Record/Playback feature of the Mimic App not only reduces the flaky failure percentage but also reduces the effort to maintain API services locally. With this solution in place, we have been able to achieve an average daily pass percentage of 95% in Espresso Tests.</p>

								<h5>Image Injection in Espresso</h5>
								<h6>3:45 PM&ndash;4:15 PM <span>&#8226; Mani Ranganathan</span></h6>
								<p>Remote Deposit Capture (RDC) is one of the fastest growing trends in Banking technology and has been termed as &ldquo;The most important development the (U.S.) banking industry has seen in years&rdquo;. Testing features like RDC manually is a tedious job, especially in Android world, with such a wide variety of devices and versions. So, it becomes very important that we automate it. However, with tools like Calabash and Appium, automating these seemed impossible. Thanks to Google Espresso we now have the ability to inject an image during the test execution flow that provides an ability to automate RDC. In this talk, we will look at how we can inject an image to simulate a check capture during execution which in turn would save the huge effort required to test RDC manually.</p>

								<h5>First, Do No Harm</h5>

								<p>Developing Android applications is a powerful way to connect people with the information they need the most. Unlike doctors, we were not required to take an oath or pledge when becoming Android Developers. However, we can still learn much from the principles behind the phrase, &ldquo;First, do no harm.&rdquo; In this talk, we will discuss over a dozen tools that are at your disposal as a developer which can enable you to provide high quality applications to your users. We start out by covering items you can use to increase your Android know-how. Next we move on to five techniques for keeping bugs our of your applications. Finally, we cover the best tools available for tracking down issues when they do arise. Thus allowing you to first, do no harm!</p>
